# üîç QA Testing issue for vX.0.0 Release
### What to test
Before each release, we need to test dotclinic or dotlink according to a standardized protocol, which you can find in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/dotbase/78a5429585f24663889491eac952d6a5?v=0afb836fcf004b04a6c08e385d61a100&pvs=4).

### How to test
1. Please open [Notion](https://www.notion.so/dotbase/78a5429585f24663889491eac952d6a5?v=0afb836fcf004b04a6c08e385d61a100&pvs=4) 
2. Create another "Testing checklist" by choosing from the "dotclinic" or "dotlink" template.
3. Test all relevant dotbase functions by following the template. Thereby focus on the new release specific features. At the same time, it must be ensured that all standard dotbase features continue to function flawlessly.
