name: Synchronize Release Branch and Main Branch after a Hotfix Release

# After releasing a hotfix, the release branch needs to be synchronized with the main branch again. 
# Ohterwise, hotfixes would never appear on the main branch and could also cause unexpected merge conflicts for the next regular release
# If there are no merge conflicts between release and main, we automatically merge release into main.
# If merge conflicts appear, this action only opens a PR on main.
